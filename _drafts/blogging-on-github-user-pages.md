title: What Do I Really Need to Know to Setup a GitHub Blog?
category: blog
tags: [jekyll, yaml, liquid-templates, markdown, html, css, javascript, compass, sass, ruby, gems, python, git]

I thought it would be a good idea to  create a blog to talk about software development, design patterns, learning programming languages and development environments and a whole slew of related topics I find interesting. I also thought I could keep it simple by using [GitHub User Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/),  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/). What I've found is that I have only a passing familiarity with most of the technologies one needs to know to use these tools.
