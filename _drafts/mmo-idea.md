I've just read an article in The Atlantic, [When a Video-Game World Ends](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/when-a-video-game-world-ends/423360/?single_page=true). It made me wonder whether it would be fun to have an MMO where the story starts in a dystopian world, probably post-apocolypse, and players find relics through archeological digs with the goal of bringing back past civilizations or building new ones with the relics as their foundation.

I wonder what conflicts could ensue, how could information from the past be used, interpreted, misinterpreted and abused as players work together and against other groups to bring some kind of hope or glory to their otherwise meager existence.

Where do players start and what are they doing? Are they like Star Wars bounty hunters, or merely waiting tables in a dusty cantina on the Outer Rim? How do events unfold to open opportunities for players to get out of a mundane life and on the path to achievement, hope and glory?

What did Sony do right before they changed Star Wars Galaxy to emphasize combat? What attracted players to the original and made them revolt from the redesigned game? According to [Remembering the Beautifully Boring MMO Star Wars Galaxy](https://killscreen.com/articles/remembering-the-beautifully-boring-mmo-star-wars-galaxies/), the key to its original success was that players weren't forced into combat roles. They could fulfil any combination of over 40 different jobs, including politician, chef, musician, tailor and image designer. Players could run cities or create items to help other players. One could also open a shop or an entire shopping mall. These are the kinds of roles filled by non-player characters in other MMOs.

The [Star Wars Galaxy](http://swg.wikia.com/wiki/SWG_Wiki) has a [professions tree](http://swg.wikia.com/wiki/Professions_(pre-NGE)) that represents the state of affairs before the New Game Enhancements (NGE). The professions are split into several categories:
