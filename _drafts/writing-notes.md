[This article](http://writingcommons.org/index.php/open-text/style/point-of-view/635-understanding-second-person-point-of-view-wizard-activity) is the most enjoyable description of how to use the first, second and third person points of view I've ever seen.

## Point of View
- Use the first person for telling personal stories and anecdotes.
- Use the second person for things like instruction manuals, to paint a picture for people or to make clear that a situation is personally important to your reader. For example, I could say, "imagine that you need to finish a piece of writing for class and keep getting frustrating advice from crackpot wizards." You can also use the second person in role-playing games. For example, your character will be going on an adventure and you will suddenly be presented with a couple of options. "You turn left." "You turn right." I have fun playing those games.
- Use the third person when you want to present the thoughts of another character or group. This point of view enables you to know and talk about people besides yourself and what you have experienced. You could report on someone else's research, or describe what they need to do. You could write a story in which someone else went on an adventure. However, unlike the first person, the personal pronoun cannot be used to describe the character.
