excerpt: Blogging about software development

I'm a senior software engineer, who develops Windows applications and kernel drivers in C and C++. I'm also branching out into Linux, Python and Java development. I have extensive experience working with customers to increase the joy and satisfaction using our products.

I have been working in a sustaining engineering role, but would like to move into a development role where I can help lead the effort to improve software quality and the practices to make that happen.
