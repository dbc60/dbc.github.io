excerpt: Blogging about software development
---
My name is Doug Cuthbertson, and this is my blog. I'm a professional programmer and software engineer living in Chelmsford, Massachusetts in the USA. I have experience in developing applications and kernel drivers on Microsoft Windows in C and C++. Lately, I'm feeling a strong need to truly learn more about my craft.

I tend to read too much about software development and not write enough code, so my intent is to use this blog to explore some of the aspects of coding and engineering I've enjoyed reading about and put them into practice. Some of the subjects I intend to explore are basic things like organizing a development environment for a project, as well as using design patterns, algorithms and data structures I find interesting.

My first few posts will be about how I set up this blog. I learned a little bit about Jekyll, YAML, Liquid templates, HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript. I've barely touched upon these during my career, so it is a new experience that I want to record.
