      <description>&lt;p&gt;October 1st, 2021 &lt;a href=&#34;https://f5.com&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;F5 Networks&lt;/a&gt; acquired &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.threatstack.com/&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Threat Stack&lt;/a&gt;! As far as I know, F5 did not layoff anyone from Threat Stack. They treated the acquistion like they were hiring individuals and made separate offers that each person could choose to accept or not. I think most were given offers for permanent positions, while some others were offered temporary positions to help with the transition. I chose to stay, and am still working on the (formerly Threat Stack) agents. I am the primary developer of the Windows Agent, and am a significant contributor to the Linux, containerized, and Fargate agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threat Stack was a great place to work, and so far F5 is equally as good. Every F5&amp;rsquo;er I&amp;rsquo;ve met to date has been very welcoming and a pleasure to chat with. Like Threat Stack, F5 has a generous work-from-home policy of which I&amp;rsquo;m taking full advantage. I do NOT miss commuting an hour and a half each way between home and the Boston office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is inspired by Derek Siver&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/nowff&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;/now page movement&lt;/a&gt;. You can see &lt;a href=&#34;http://nownownow.com/&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;lots of sites&lt;/a&gt; which have &lt;code&gt;/now&lt;/code&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good day! I&amp;rsquo;m Douglas Cuthbertson, a professional software engineer living in Massachusetts. Mostly, I develop applications and kernel drivers on Microsoft Windows. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing software in &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; for both Linux and Windows (it&amp;rsquo;s my new favorite programming language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to read too much about software development and not write enough code, so my intent is to use this blog to explore some of the aspects of coding and engineering I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed reading about and put them into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides my professional work, I&amp;rsquo;m a husband, a father to two really wonderful children who have grown up and are launching careers of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dream about model railroads (it was a favorite hobby of mine and I hope to get back to it one day soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take photographs, and occasionally sketch and draw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enjoy gardening and cooking with my wife, Adelle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banner is a picture I took on a trip to Rockport, MA. with my family several years ago. The building is commonly known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_Number_1&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Motif No. 1&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a replica of an old fishing shack built in 1840. The original was destroyed during the blizzard of 1978.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See my &lt;a href=&#34;https://douglascuthbertson.com/now/&#34;&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt; page for what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to lately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
