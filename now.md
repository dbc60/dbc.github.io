excerpt: What have I done lately?
---
I'm between jobs, so I'm interviewing with various companies for permanent or contract work. In fact, I have a phone interview with [Verizon](http://www.verizon.com/) today (January 21, 2016).

I'm looking into the design of the LMAX Disruptor pattern and how to use that to create a processing pipeline (probably with ZeroMQ).

Why, might you ask am I working on that particular project? Lately, I've been thinking about my career a lot, and noticed that most of my work has been on small components of larger projects. Some of the potential employers I've spoken with have found that my experience is either not low-level enough, or not contributing to a large enough project. I seem to have fallen into some in-between level of experience.

To remedy that, while I continue to look for gainful employment, I decided to see what it would take to build a distributed data-backup application. I know - it's mundane and there are lots of backup services already. What's important isn't the particular application (though, there is a lot of data generated every day, so there's always a need for more backup capability). What is important is the experience in designing and building the components needed to create a scalable, distributed, secure service. It's also a subject that is important to me. I have lots of notes, photos and videos that I would hate to lose, so I think it's a good exercise to see if I can make a backup service for which I have a vested interest.
