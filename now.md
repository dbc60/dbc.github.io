excerpt: What have I done lately?

I'm working for [Threat Stack, Inc](https://www.threatstack.com/). in Boston Massachusetts. I'm on the Agent Team, porting their agent from Linux to Windows.

This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [/now page movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). You can see [lots of sites](http://nownownow.com/) which have /now pages.
