title: What I'm Doing Now
permalink: /now/

To pay the bills, I'm working for [Threat Stack, Inc](https://www.threatstack.com/). in Boston Massachusetts. I'm on the Agent Team. At the moment, I *am* the Windows Agent Team. I also practice the art of Hawaiian Shaolin Kempo, think about creating a model railroad, and play with [Jeyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for blogging and note taking.

This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [/now page movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). You can see [lots of sites](http://nownownow.com/) which have `/now` pages.
